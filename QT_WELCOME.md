## What You Have

### 1. **Run Letters** - Your Personal Running Journal
**NEW! Built just for you.**

This turns every run into a reflective letter. Think of it like a journal that writes itself.

**Where to find it:** Click **"Run Letters"** in the left sidebar (3rd item down)

**What you'll see:**
- AI-generated reflective notes about each run
- Your current running streak
- Distance, pace, and time for each run
- Ability to edit any letter to add your own thoughts

**Example letter:**
> "4.3 miles through familiar streets. Your heart rate stayed low—conservation mode. Sometimes the best runs are the ones that don't demand anything from you."

**What you can do:**
- ✅ **Edit** - Click "Edit" to customize any letter with your own words
- ✅ **Share** - Click "Make Public" then "Copy Link" to share on social media
- ✅ **Keep Private** - All letters are private by default

---

### 2. **All Original Training Tools**
You still have access to everything from the original app:

- **Dashboard** - Overview of your training
- **Activities** - Full list of all your runs
- **Segments** - Your performance on Strava segments
- **Monthly Stats** - Calendar view of your training
- **Eddington Chart** - Distance milestones
- **Heatmap** - Map of everywhere you've run
- **Best Efforts** - Your fastest times
- **Rewind** - Year in review
- **Challenges** - Strava challenges you've completed
- **Photos** - Pictures from your runs

## How to Use Run Letters

### First Time Setup (One Time Only)

After your first Strava sync, letters will be automatically generated for new runs.

**To generate letters for your past runs:**

1. Log into your Render dashboard
2. Go to your web service
3. Click "Shell" (top right)
4. Run this command:
```bash
php bin/console app:backfill:run-letters
```

That's it! This creates letters for all your historical running activities.

### Daily Use (Automatic!)

**Every time Strava syncs a new run:**
1. Activity imports automatically
2. Letter generates automatically
3. You get an email notification (if configured)
4. Visit "Run Letters" to see it

**No manual work required!**

2. Find the run you want to share
3. Click **"Make Public"**

5. Paste the link anywhere (Instagram bio, Twitter, email, etc.)

People who click the link will see:
- Your beautiful letter
